    "This paper discusses the techniques used in creating deepfake videos, particularly focusing on deep video portraits. It addresses the technological advances in facial reenactment and replacement that make deepfakes possible. The reading will provide students with a foundational understanding of the technical aspects of deepfake creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Link -> https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11714\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. \"The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence: Forecasting, Prevention, and Mitigation\" by Brundage et al. (Required)\n",
    "\n",
    "This report covers broader issues concerning the malicious uses of AI, including deepfakes. It offers a comprehensive analysis of potential threats, ethical considerations, and mitigation strategies. This document will help frame the discussion on the societal and ethical implications of deepfakes.\n",
