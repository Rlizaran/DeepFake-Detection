    "### Readings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. \"Deepfakes: Techniques, Challenges and Solutions\" by A. Rossi et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the techniques used in creating deepfakes, highlighting the evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their application in synthesizing realistic videos and images. The reading will equip students with a technical understanding of how deepfakes are constructed.\n",
    "The ethical dilemmas posed by deepfakes, such as misinformation and privacy invasion, are discussed. This will set the stage for ethical considerations in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. \"Facing Reality: The Ethical Challenges of Deepfakes\" by C. Fletcher\n",
    "\n",
    "This article delves into the societal and ethical impacts of deepfakes, offering a philosophical perspective on the responsibilities of AI developers and users. It encourages students to think critically about the broader implications of emerging technologies.\n",
    "The reading also explores current and proposed legal frameworks aimed at regulating deepfakes, providing a basis for the discussion on policy and ethical guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lecture description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
