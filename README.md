# DeepFake Detection Proposal
## Overview
This project proposal is part of a special topics course focusing on researching DeepFake algorithms. The goal is to educate peers on how DeepFake tools work and the principles behind detecting DeepFake content, without involving any coding.

## Objectives
* Understand DeepFake Technology: Learn about the creation and implications of DeepFake videos.
* Educational Presentation: Present research findings in class to explain how to detect DeepFake content.
## Methodology
* Literature Review: Study existing methods and theories on DeepFake detection.
* Video Analysis: Watch relevant videos to understand the technology and detection techniques.
* Peer Education: Prepare and deliver a presentation summarizing the research.
## Tools and Resources
* Resources: Academic papers, online articles, and educational videos
* Presentation Tools: Google Slides
## Expected Outcomes
* A comprehensive understanding of DeepFake detection methods.
* An educational presentation for peers on the findings.
